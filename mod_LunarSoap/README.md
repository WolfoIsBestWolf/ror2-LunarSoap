A Lunar item intended to help with those runs where you get no speed.  
Especially as characters without a movement ability such as Artificer, Engineer, Captain and maybe modded ones like Enforcer or Paladin.

The item changes your walk speed without changing your movement stat, which leads to most utility skills not gaining extra distance.

The downside of low acceleration is more noticeable when sprinting and acceleration not scaling with speed ups means more speed ups will function not as well.

Yeah the item is a brick but I hope it still looks fitting among the other Lunars.
